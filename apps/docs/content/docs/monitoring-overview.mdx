You can simulated requests to monitor the availability and performance of your website, API, or server from various locations around the world.
We will make a request to your website or API on a regular schedule and record the responses.
We will alert you if your website or API is down, is timing out or does not return the expected response.

### What is a monitor?

A monitor is a job that runs periodically or on-demand and checks the status of a service. It can be a website, an API, or anything else that can be checked automatically.
We will make a request to your endpoint and record the results.

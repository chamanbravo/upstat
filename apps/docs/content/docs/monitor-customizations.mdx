### Assertions
By default we expect the endpoint to return a `200` status code. If you want to check for a different status code you can go to to the Assertions tab and add a new assertion.
We support status code, header and body string assertions.

### Frequency
By default, Upstat will check your service every 1 minute.<br/>
We support the following frequencies:
- Every 1 minute
- Every 5 minutes
- Every 15 minutes
- Every 30 minutes
- Every 1 hour

### Notifications
If you want to receive notifications when your monitor fails, you can connect it to a notification channel.<br/>
You will have the list of available notification channels. You can connect your monitor to one or multiple notification channels.<br/>
You need to create a notification channel before connecting your monitor to it.
